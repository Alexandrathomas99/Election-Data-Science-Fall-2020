# Welcome to Election Data Science!

--
- What is data science?
--

- The main approaches to it.
--

- Some critical things to keep in mind about it.
--

- What we are and aren't going to learn in this class.

# What Is Data Science **To You?**

# What Does Data Science Mean?

--

&lt;img src="pic1.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--
- It's a new field, but also not?

--
- Instead it's helpful to think of data science not as a rigid field but as a *constellation* of competencies. 

???
- Can trace its intellectual origins to the 1950s and 60s.
- A lot of the techniques used have been theorized for decades but we lacked the computational power
- As a term it's really only come about over the last 15 or so years.
  - That term has changed meanings.
- Because of that, a lot of people think that "Data Science" is just a sexy new way to describe "Applied statistics."

These competencies guide practitioners in the art of *constructing narratives* resting upon information *curated* and *synthesized* from machine-readable data.]  

???
- "narrative" is kind of a bing word but throughout the semester, you'll see that it's
actually the perfect way to describe what it is we do.

# 3 Main Approaches to Data Science
--

1. **Data Exploration:** 
  - Looking for correlations and correspondences between different data objects.
  - Used to segment voters by issue, explore results and turnout patterns, etc.

--

2. **Prediction:**
  - Using data about what *has* happened (or is happening) to predict what *will* happen.
  - Turnout predictions, likely voter models, etc.
--

3. **Causal Inference:**
  - Going *deeper* than association. Seeing if two (or more things) are causally linked.
  - Do campaign adverts *actually* work? When and for whom?
  - Most commonly aped. Not most commonly done.]


???
A fourth approach is to build the tools that we need for the other 3.
In my personal opinion, the thing that separates bad/good data scientists from good/great ones are two things

---
# 2 Big Things

--

.pull-left[
1. A drive to continuously learn.
  - There are always new techniques to learn.
  - There is always new, helpful knowledge to be gained.
  - But it's deliberate, purposeful learning. 
2. Deep consideration of the **D.G.P**
  - **D**ata **G**eneration **P**rocess.]

# The DL on the DGP

At every stage of the process, there is not only the opportunity for human error, but there is unavoidable informational limits that are basically set by reality.

- For example: Does nature generate the phenomenon if human events have catalyzed it? How much of it is due to how things are versus how we set them up to be? 
- How is the phenomenon witnessed? Some things aren't even witnessable unless you look at it with the right perspective. 
- Then you get into things like sampling frames, selection, etc. Where is the information even coming from?
- Information encoding runs up to issues with floating point numbers because our computers are all ultimately based around base two. On the human end of things continuous phenomena are discretized. 
- Some information is nixed. Or it's simplified. Or it's framed a certain way.
- Sometimes you get aggregated data, or data that has undergone a more advanced procedure.
- By the time information has been delivered to you, ready to import into R and analyze, it is irreparably different than how "nature" generated it.
- Then once you analyze it you can still mess up.

You need to get in the habit of **knowing** that your data are invariably *wrong.* They will carry bias---some obvious, some subterranean. Data are always mere **_approximations_** of nature.]

???
We have a word for constructing simplifications out of messy realities with the intention of someone, somewhere, getting something useful out of it: Telling stories. The models we provide are stories that we tell.

# What you *are* going to learn (at least I hope).

- Programming languages are just that--*languages*
  - So is maths, for that matter.
- Computers are the dumbest kind of magic.
- Data **never** speak for themselves.
- As data professionals, you have an inherent obligation to be ethical in your handling of data and in your presentation of your results. Every point is a *person.* Every narrative impacts **real people.**
- Analytical procedures never make anything *objective.* Objectivity is not a thing that actually exists. (Or, at the very least, is not attainable by us mere mortals.)
- All data are artifacts of the time, place, people, and culture they are generated from. There meanings are laden with this context.
