# Mapping is immensely important to elections
--

- Elections are geographically constrained & defined phenomena.
--

- Variety of purposes *pre*- and **post**-election:
  - *Redistricting*
  - *Precinct locations*
  - *Campaigning*
  - *Election-night turnout projections*
  - **_Civil Rights Work_**
  - **Exploring aggregate correlations**
  - **Inferential analysis**

Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it's essential.

# It's inherently part of making maps.

.pull-left[Gauss proved that it was impossible to flatten a sphere so that all of the following 5 elements are maintained:

1. Area
2. Shape
3. Distance
4. Angle
5. Direction

# Squaring the cirlce (or flattening the sphere)
How do we get maps then?
--

- Geoid models:
  - Models of the earth
  - Develop local datums
--

- Selecting the surface type:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='left', out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/images/3/3f/Developable_Surfaces.jpg")

```
--

- Selecting projection intent:
  - equal area; conformal; azimuthal; equidistant
  
---
class: center, middle
# Keep in mind that when you map, you are always using a *projection*. And projection choices have consequences.

---
# Do I really need a map?
--

Just because a point has a geographic element doesn't mean your story is about geography.

# Provided you do, there are a number of choices you will make:

.pull-left[
1. Projection
  - Your distortion of choice. (Good name for a band imho.)
2. Scale
  - Smaller maps are inherently limited in their truth-telling capacity.
3. Included symbols.
  - 6 verbs: color, greyscale, size, direction, texture, and shape.

# The most common maps you will make:

1. Chloropleth maps
2. Point maps.
3. Heat maps
4. Line maps
5. Flow maps
5. Interactive maps.
